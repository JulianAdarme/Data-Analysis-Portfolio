## Description

This first dashboard presents a detailed visualization of violent deaths in Colombia during the first quarter of 2024, organized by city and manner of death. The raw data was retrieved from an official government platform [LinkForense], which initially provided a useful baseline for analysis. However, to achieve the insights shown here, extensive data cleaning and restructuring were required using both Excel and Power Query within Power BI.

The project involved refining city-level monthly records, building calculated columns, and applying logic-based transformations to create a coherent, time-aware structure. Key analytics like month-over-month percentage variations were made possible through DAX formulation, which enabled dynamic calculations and visual summaries such as line charts, donut visuals, and conditional color formatting.

Beyond the technical work, this project pushed a deeper understanding of Power BI‚Äôs data model, measure evaluation context, and interactive dashboard design. The final result is a fully navigable report that reveals temporal and geographic patterns in violent deaths‚Äîa step toward making this sensitive information accessible and actionable. The complete report can be found in this git.

This dashboard is the result of a course project where I analyzed sales data from a hypothetical market using theoretical values, names, and structures. While the dataset was fictional, the workflow closely mirrors real-world scenarios. I began by cleaning and enriching the dataset‚Äîstandardizing inconsistent entries and grouping scattered information to provide clearer context.

After preparing the data in Power BI, I moved on to the analysis phase. This included calculating key performance indicators such as total sales, average sales, sales trends by weekday, and the percentage share of subscription-based purchases. The final deliverable is a dynamic, interactive dashboard with real-time filters, built with a focus on readability and accessible insights.

Last but not least. This project presents a market performance overview for Games Workshop, the company behind the Warhammer franchise. Using publicly available financial data, I designed a dashboard to explore the stock market behavior of the company across recent years.

The dashboard includes:

üìä Monthly Average Closure with benchmark comparison.

üîç Anomaly Detection using statistical banding to highlight deviations.

üîÆ Forecasting of future closures using time series models, complete with confidence intervals.

All data was processed and analyzed in Power BI, involving data preparation, anomaly detection logic, and time-based forecasting models. I focused on building a clean and intuitive visualization while keeping a thematic aesthetic aligned with the Warhammer brand.

This project is part of my portfolio showcasing analytical storytelling in financial contexts.
