# Excel-Market-Sales
## Description
This is the culmination of an exploratory project. I am very proud of the result and hope you like what you'll find here.

Here I analyzed the sales of a hypothetical market using theoretical values, names, and data in general. As an exercise, I cleaned and complemented this data with clearer values and grouped others that were spread out and didn't mean much.
After the cleanse and organization, I proceeded with the analysis which involved some basic KPIs such as total sales, average sales, average sales day of the week, and percentage of sales for the subscription method. 
Finally, create a personalized real-time dashboard, with dynamic filters and keeping the readability of the remarkable metrics.
